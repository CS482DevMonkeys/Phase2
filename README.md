# Phase2

Use this tutorial to download MySql, Apache, and PHP. Follow the instructions exactly:

You may noticed I did not upload the bin folder that should be found under C:/Server. This contains all the MySQL, Apache, and PHP configurations which contains very large files that I cannot add on github. 

Another thing that is missing in this commit is that I removed "DB" folder that should be under C:/Server/data/. I decided to remove it because I figured there are probably other large files that may not be able to be commited to github. 

Now, that I mentioned that those folders are missing, you will need to add them back in to your directories using the instructions in the tutorial. 

Once, you finished downloading MySql8.0, Apache, and PHP, you will now be able to manipulate the php files found under C:/Server/data/htdocs. 

The file called phase2 is the file that is used for the interface as well as the file to connect to the database. 

I don't think you will need to connect to my database manually in mysql workbench. It should just work fine once you have MySql, Apache, and PHP installed.
